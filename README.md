# Facial Emotion Analysis

A machine learning project to detect and classify human facial emotions from images.



## Problem Statement
Understanding human emotions through facial expressions plays a vital role in human-computer interaction, surveillance, and assistive technologies.



## Approach
- Image preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Emotion classification using ML models



## Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Computer Vision & ML libraries

```



## Results
The model is capable of identifying basic human emotions from facial images with reasonable accuracy.



## Future Work
- Extend to real-time video emotion recognition
- Improve robustness across lighting and pose variations
